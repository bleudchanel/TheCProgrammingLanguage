# Solving the exercises of "The C Programming Language" book
by Wilmer Vidal Uruchi Ticona wilmer.vidal.uruchi@est.fib.upc.edu

As a way to get a solid understanding of this ancient yet still useful language, I decided to get into the adventure of going through the book in its entirety, and solve the exercises of each chapter.

This is a work in progress, I will try to update as often as possible with new exercises, but it will take a while, not only because of the complexity of the task at hand, but also for my lack of free time.

The exercises will be distributed as .c files organized by files according to the corresponding chapter.

Best Regards,
Wilmer
