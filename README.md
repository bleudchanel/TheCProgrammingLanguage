# Solving the Assignments of MIT 6.042J / 18.062J Mathematics for Computer Science
by Wilmer Vidal Uruchi Ticona wilmer.vidal.uruchi@est.fib.upc.edu

As a way to remember some concepts I forgot with time, and to learn others that I was never taught, I decided to undertake the task of solving the assignments of the freely available course of MIT 6.042J / 18.062J Mathematics for Computer Science, which you can find here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm.

This is a work in progress, I will try to update as often as possible with new exercises, but it will take a while, not only for the complexity of the course, but also for my lack of free time.

The assignments will be presented as PDF files, and I will include the tex file also.

Also, a big thanks to MIT for making this useful material available for free.

Best Regards,
Wilmer
