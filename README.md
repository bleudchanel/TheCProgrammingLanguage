\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Solving the Assignments of MIT 6.042J / 18.062J Mathematics for Computer Science\
by Wilmer Vidal Uruchi Ticona wilmer.vidal.uruchi@est.fib.upc.edu\
\
As a way to remember some concepts I forgot with time, and to learn others that I was never taught, I decided to undertake the task of solving the assignments of the freely available course of MIT 6.042J / 18.062J Mathematics for Computer Science, which you can find here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm.\
\
This is a work in progress, I will try to update as often as possible with new exercises, but it will take a while, not only for the complexity of the course, but also for my lack of free time.\
\
The assignments will be presented as PDF files, and I will include the tex file also.\
\
Also, a big thanks to MIT for making this useful material available for free.\
\
Best Regards,\
\
Wilmer\
